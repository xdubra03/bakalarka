This is the usage guide for prediction tool. For running this tools you will need to install required libraries. To install them, you can use these following commands using pip:
1. Install Scikit-learn
pip install -U scikit-learn
2. Install ete3
pip install --upgrade ete3
3. Install Biopython
pip install biopython

After running these commmands, tool is ready to use. All external programs used in tool are provided on attached DVD. Prediction tool requires Python version 2.7. Tool is launched from the command line and has several input parameters:  

./stability_predictor.py PDB_ID CHAIN POSITION WILD_TYPE MUTANT (-h|--help)

PDB_ID PDB protein identifier
CHAIN chain type 
POSITION position of mutation, if position of the first residue is not 1, position has to be recomputed
WILD_TYPE amino acid before mutation
MUTANT amino acid after mutation
-h|--help print help 

This is the example of input:

./stability_predictor.py 1AJ3 A 87 K G

Output has simple text format and has following structure:

------------RESULTS------------
PDB ID: 1AJ3
CHAIN TYPE: A
WILD TYPE ACID: K
MUTANT ACID: G
POSITION OF MUTATION: 87
TYPE OF MUTATION: stabilizing
